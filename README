	       Exercise 11
--------------------------------------------
  1. In this exercise we practiced MongoDB using Mlab platform.
  2. I used bodyparser for data input validation.
  3. I implemented a simple node.js CRUD server for music songs. 
     Each song has standard fields like song name, artist and genre.

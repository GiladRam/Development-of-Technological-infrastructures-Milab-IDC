	Exersice 10
-------------------------------------------
1. I did this exersice with Tomer Mimon 
2. In my repo you can find the server side.
3. The Node JS server monitor stock qoutes from Alpha Vantage.
4. Tomer implemented an android client for it which allows to enter stock name
   and  send the client information (stock price).
5. The server updates the clinet every every 15 seconds using Firebase.

	Thanks a lot,
